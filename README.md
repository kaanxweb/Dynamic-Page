!!New Update Coming Soon!!

Dynamic Page

:bangbang: Important! There is not only a dynamic page structure here, but also a dynamic language structure. The language is organized to appear in the url as well.

:white_square_button: This structure allows you to create pages through the "pages" table in the database, and you can enter the details of the page you created in detail through the "page_detail" table, and you can connect to the view you want with the "access_name" column of your "page" table.

:key: Don't remember. You need to run:

php artisan migrate

php artisan db:seed

commands.

:sunrise: In addition, I have left 2 create files in the view so that you can add new data. Don't forget to review!
